Setup is easy

You just need to run command git clone https://github.com/tunilo/Ramwaste_Project.git

AS LONG AS  this code is using not local websites, you dont need to setup other things. 

In src/test folder there is UI and API tests.

If it has errors sync pom.xml file

If u dont have pw installed
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install
